# ERC4337 Audit Checklist

## Checklist

### General

- [x] How are the audited contracts different from [Infinitism's sample contracts](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/tree/v0.6.0/contracts/samples)?
- [x] Can the project be deployed on targeted EVM-compatible chains, e.g. through the correct version of the Solidity compiler?
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/M-04: Project may fail to be deployed to chains not compatible with Shanghai hardfork](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#m-04-project-may-fail-to-be-deployed-to-chains-not-compatible-with-shanghai-hardfork)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L2)
- [x] Do the components support the latest [EntryPoint contract](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/releases)?

### Wallet Account Factory

- [x] Does it use CREATE2 to create the wallet?
  - [ERC-4337: The factory is expected to use CREATE2 (not CREATE) to create the wallet](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#first-time-account-creation)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccountFactory.sol#L44)
- [x] Does it return the wallet account address even if it has already been created?
  - [ERC-4337: If the factory does use CREATE2 or some other deterministic method to create the wallet, it’s expected to return the wallet address even if the wallet has already been created.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#first-time-account-creation)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccountFactory.sol#L32)
- [x] Can an attacker gain control of the wallet account by deploying it on behalf of its owner?
  - [ERC-4337: For security reasons, it is important that the generated contract address will depend on the initial signature. This way, even if someone can create a wallet at that address, he can’t set different credentials to control it.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#first-time-account-creation)
  - [Code4rena/Biconomy/H-03: Attacker can gain control of counterfactual wallet](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-biconomy#h-03-attacker-can-gain-control-of-counterfactual-wallet)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/L-01: `AmbireAccountFactory.deploySafe()` does not guarantee that no call hasn’t already been made on the deployed contract](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#l-01-ambireaccountfactorydeploysafe-does-not-guarantee-that-no-call-hasnt-already-been-made-on-the-deployed-contract)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccountFactory.sol#L29)
- [x] Does the factory allow anyone to add stake to the entrypoint? In that case, the `unstakeDelay` may not be changed, otherwise it could be set to high value, preventing unstaking

### Wallet Account

- [x] Can the wallet account implementation contract be initialized by an attacker, e.g. through frontrunning?
  - [Code4rena/Biconomy/H-01: Destruction of the SmartAccount implementation](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-biconomy#h-01-destruction-of-the-smartaccount-implementation)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/M-05: AmbireAccount implementation can be destroyed by privileges](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#m-05-ambireaccount-implementation-can-be-destroyed-by-privileges)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L46)
- [x] Can the wallet account execute transactions without going through the EntryPoint, and if so, are access controls and signature validations properly implemented?
  - [Code4rena/Biconomy/H-04: Arbitrary transactions possible due to insufficient signature validation](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-biconomy#h-04-arbitrary-transactions-possible-due-to-insufficient-signature-validation)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/M-03: Recovery transaction can be replayed after a cancellation](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#m-03-recovery-transaction-can-be-replayed-after-a-cancellation)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/L-02: Fallback handler should not be allowed to be this](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#l-02-fallback-handler-should-not-be-allowed-to-be-this)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/L-16: Transactions bundles signed for a future nonce cannot be cancelled](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#l-16-transactions-bundles-signed-for-a-future-nonce-cannot-be-cancelled)
  - [ZeroDev/Kernel/ZeroDev-wallet-02: Signature Replay Attack can be done on validateUserOp of Kernel](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel/blob/main/audits/kalos_v1.pdf)
  - [ZeroDev/Kernel/ZeroDev-wallet-05: Incomplete Validation of Operation Types in Session Verification](https://github.com/zerodevapp/kernel/blob/main/audits/kalos_v1.pdf)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L58)
- [x] Does the wallet account use different signature validation schemes, and are they correctly implemented?
  - [ERC-4337: If the account does not support signature aggregation, it MUST validate the signature is a valid signature of the `userOpHash`, and SHOULD return `SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED` (and not revert) on signature mismatch. Any other error should revert.](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#definitions)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/L-03: Schnorr signature validation may be incompatible with the intended signers](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#l-03-schnorr-signature-validation-may-be-incompatible-with-the-intended-signers)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/L-04: Schnorr signature length is not checked](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#l-04-schnorr-signature-length-is-not-checked)
  - [Code4rena/Ambire/L-15: `require(sp != 0);` fails to protect Schnorr signature validation](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-05-ambire#l-15-requiresp--0-fails-to-protect-schnorr-signature-validation)
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L96)
- [x] Does the wallet account implement ERC-1271, and if so, can "owners" be shared between accounts?
  - In most naive implementations of `isValidSignature()` (e.g. one that checks that *some* owner has signed the `bytes32 hash`), signatures can be replayed across accounts with shared owners. The hash needs to be altered by the account (e.g. using EIP-712) so that a signature is [only valid for a specific wallet](https://github.com/SoulWallet/soul-wallet-contract/blob/d0895e0d0990dd25f39254fee707d7898a852652/contracts/helper/SignatureValidator.sol#L18-L24).
  - [Correct implementation in Safe contracts](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-contracts/blob/69caefcda788f2f6b0b154d50d010897560c8deb/contracts/handler/CompatibilityFallbackHandler.sol#L57-L68)
- [x] Does the wallet only access storage fields that are associated with the sender? Otherwise, [standard bundlers](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#storage-associated-with-an-address) won't support it
- [x] Is the wallet proxy based? If so, which proxy is used? If its an `ERC1967Proxy`, does it comply to the standard?
  - [Non-issue in Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol#L10)
- [x] Can the smart contract account be converted to another type of smart contract account (via the proxy pattern)? Could the initalizable storage slot [be reused](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4782)?
- [x] Does the wallet account support modules? If so what type? Does it comply to the specs (e.g. if `delegatecall` is used, no storage slots overlaps)? What is the process the review modules? What is the process to register modules?
  - `delegatecall` based
    - [ZeroDev](https://docs.zerodev.app/extend-wallets/overview)
    - [Diamond Pattern EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)
    - [Safe](https://docs.safe.global/safe-smart-account/modules)
  - `call` based
    - [EIP-6900](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900)
    - [Universal Profile (slightly different)](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/tree/main/LSPs)
- [x] Does the wallet support session keys?
  - [Biconomy](https://www.biconomy.io/post/modular-session-keys)
  - [ZeroDev](https://docs.zerodev.app/blog/session-keys-are-the-jwts-of-web3), [ref](https://docs.zerodev.app/use-wallets/use-session-keys)
  - [MatchboxDAO](https://mirror.xyz/matchboxdao.eth/VXOvLKIvfXHP-cusKHw55zqlHpvvWwzh_fqm6j48Yek)

### Paymaster

- [x] Can VerifyingPaymaster signatures be replayed?
  - [Code4rena/Biconomy/H-05: Paymaster’s signature can be replayed to drain their deposits](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-biconomy#h-05-paymaster-eth-can-be-drained-with-malicious-sender)
  - [Code4rena/Biconomy/M-03: Cross-Chain Signature Replay Attack](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-01-biconomy#m-03-cross-chain-signature-replay-attack)
  - [Non-issue](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/VerifyingPaymaster.sol#L64) in [Infinitism sample](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/v0.6.0/contracts/samples/VerifyingPaymaster.sol#L88)
- [x] Can arbitrary error messages happen in the `postOp()` function?
  - There is a [bug in the v0.6 entrypoint](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/pull/293) that results in the mishandling of short revert messages. This means a revert in the initial `postOp()` call can revert the entire bundle, even though it's expected that a second `postOp()` call would be made.    

### Bundler

- [x] Does it implement `eth_sendRawTransactionConditional` for supporting L2s? (References: [Ethereum Foundation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@yoav/SkaX2lS9j), [Optimism](https://blog.oplabs.co/erc-4337-and-account-abstraction/), [Arbitrum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/aip-2-activate-support-for-account-abstraction-endpoint-on-one-and-nova/14790), [Polygon](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/pull/700))

### Signature Validator

- [x] Does it correctly validate user signatures for the correct amount of gas from the User Operation? [ref](https://twitter.com/abstractooor/status/1766114578616766953)

### Other chains

- [x] Does the chain (plan to) support [RIP-7560](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/RIPs/blob/native_account_abstraction/RIPS/rip-7560.md)

### Applications

- [x] Do applications use [ERC-6492: Signature Validation for Predeploy Contracts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492)? If so, do they comply to the standard?
- [x] Do applications not rely on `tx.origin` for signature checking?
- [x] Do applications always use gas estimations, instead of relying on assumptions for specific costs (e.g `21000` fixed cost of `transfer`)
- [x] Do applications support batching (not required, but can greatly improve UX)
- [x] Do appplications support paymasters (e.g. paying gas with the token that is being converted)
